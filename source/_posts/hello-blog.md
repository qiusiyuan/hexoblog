## Start
Hi everyone, this is my first blog. It's aimed for recording my journey of computer science technologies. It might contain **study notes**, **practice**, **experiment** and **problem and solution from my work**. I determine to use blog to record these things is because I find it necessary to take these things down. I think it's very useful to record what I did and what I learnt. I feel like I need a place so that later on, I can look back when I meet a problem that can be done using the similar technology or logic. I have tried 'boostnote', 'github' or even using paper and pen. I finally thought that I need a blog for this. So the essential point of this blog is not for others but for myself to refer back. It would be also good if this blog can help others :).

## 开始
大家好，这是我的第一份博客，我将用她来记录我的学习笔记，实验，练习以及我工作中遇到的问题和具体解决方案。我之所以决定要开始用博客的来记录这些，是因为我经常觉得我需要回顾之前学习的做过的东西来实现我正在遇到的问题。我需要一个地方来记录他们。我也试过boostnote，github或者直接写在纸上。但我还是觉得，一篇篇博客是最适合这个的。所以其实这个博客并不是为了给他人看或者什么的，主要是为了我自己能够在以后可以方便的回顾。但是如果能帮到他人也是很好的（笑）。
