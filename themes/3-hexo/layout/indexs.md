# Siyuan Qiu blog 邱思远的博客
This is a technique blog for Siyuan Qiu.

It can be used for:

1. Study notes
2. Technique summary
3. Experimentation
4. My opinion towards certain techniques

This blog will be probably written in either English or Chinese, or both XD. It's aimed for self study, experience sharing, and discussions. For some of my opinions, sometimes I feel like I cannot express myself properly either in English or even in Chinese. That might be because I have let the computer to express myself for a long time. As a developer, I'm used to let the programming language to show our ideas rather than talk it out. I think it's not good for me. As a society person, especially after I went to work, I need to talk to people to discuss about our ideas, express our feeling explicitly and logically. Blog is certainly a good way to improve my expression. That's why I start this. If there are any implicit statements that cause any confusion or inconvenience, which for sure would happen, please feel free to leave comments. Thank you!

此博客主要会被用作：
1. 学习笔记
2. 技术总结
3. 实战经历
4. 对于一些技术的想法和看法

我会用英文或者中文或者两个一起来写这个博客。主要是为了自我提升，分享经历和探讨一些问题。 近几年，我发现我的表达能力越来越差，无论是英文还是中文。我想可能是长期编程导致更习惯用编程语言来表达想法，而不是用文字或是口头来清晰地有逻辑地表达想法。尤其是在步入社会以后，我发现平常更多更重要的是要与人交流，清晰地，有逻辑地和人谈论，表达看法，阐论问题。我觉得博客是个很好的方式。于是我就起了这个博客。当然在博客中肯定会有不少有问题的表述，请一定留下您的评论。谢谢！
